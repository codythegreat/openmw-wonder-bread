### Description

A very simple mod that allows the player to "bake bread" similar to the game Arx Fatalis

Here is how the mod works:

1) you'll need atleast one wickwheat and one bottle
2) find a water source to fill the bottle using the hotkey (default: b)
3) with the full bottle in your inventory, place your wickwheat on the ground, move your cursor over the wickwheat and press the hotkey to convert it to dough
4) find a fire, place the dough next to the fire
5) observe the dough rising, and eventually becoming bread

### Installation

Same as any other mod. Either extract the files into your Morrowind data folder, or extract the files to another location and add it's path to OpenMW as a data directory.

### Compatibility

Should be compatible with OpenMW 0.49 or higher.

This mod does not depend on or attempt to utilize any other mods.
